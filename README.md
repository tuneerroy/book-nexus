# Book Nexus

## Description

Welcome to Book Nexus. We know that finding the next book to read from such a wide selection of options is hard. Our app will help with that, by recommending books or authors to users based on a wide variety of inputs that the user can provide.

Through our application, you will be able to view details of top rated authors and books from a selected of hundreds of thousands of titles.

## Guide to repo:

The src directory contains the main page of the appliaction, and all the React components for the project.
The backend directory contains the backend of the application.

## Running app locally:

If a `.env` file doesn't exist, please email one of us to get the file.

Run `npm install` in the root directory, and then `npm start` to start the backend. Then enter the `book-nexus-project` directory and, similarly, run `npm install` followed by `npm start` to start the frontend. The application will be running in `localhost:3000`.
